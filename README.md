# Loan-Default-Prediction-Python

# Project Overview
This project applies machine learning to predict the likelihood of loan default based on historical loan applications and credit data. The goal is to help financial institutions assess borrower risk and make smarter lending decisions.

## Project Objectives

- Build a binary classification model to predict loan default.
- Clean and preprocess real-world loan data.
- Identify high-impact features influencing default.
- Evaluate model accuracy and optimize performance.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset typically includes:
- Loan Amount
- Applicant Income
- Loan Term
- Credit History
- Debt-to-Income Ratio
- Employment Type
- Marital Status
- Loan Status (target: Defaulted or Not)

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Streamlit (for optional deployment)

## Model Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, correct data types.
2. **EDA**: Uncover relationships between features and loan default rates.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features.
4. **Model Building**: Train multiple classification models to compare performance.
5. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

## Key Insights

- Low credit history score is strongly correlated with default.
- Applicants with high debt-to-income ratios showed higher default rates.
- Shorter loan terms were associated with lower risk.
- Employment type and loan purpose also impacted default probability.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate additional variables like credit score, spending patterns, etc.
- Build an API or Streamlit app for real-time predictions.
- Apply model explainability techniques (e.g., SHAP or LIME).
